# Rockbuster-Stealth-Data-Analysis
This repository contains the analysis I performed as a Data Analyst for Rockbuster Stealth, a movie rental company transitioning to an online video service. The project aimed to assist in launching Rockbuster Stealth's new streaming service by leveraging data insights to guide key business decisions.

## Project Overview
Objective: Rockbuster Stealth LLC, once a global leader in movie rentals, is facing stiff competition from streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The company is now planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch a new online video rental service. My role as a Data Analyst was to support the Business Intelligence (BI) department in creating a data-driven strategy for this launch.

## Key Tasks and Objectives
In this project, I utilized SQL to extract insights from Rockbuster’s data and answer critical business questions posed by management. Below are the primary tasks and objectives:

#### 1) Identify Revenue Contributions:
Which movies contributed the most and least to revenue gains?
#### 2) Analyze Rental Duration:
What was the average rental duration across all videos?
#### 3) Customer Demographics:
Where are Rockbuster’s customers located?
#### 4) Lifetime Value Insights:
Identify the locations of customers with high lifetime value.
#### 5) Sales by Region:
Analyze whether sales figures vary by geographic region.
#### 6) Tools and Technologies
- PostgreSQL: Used to manage and query relational databases.
- SQL: Performed various queries to answer business questions.
- Excel & Data Visualization: Presented findings using data visualization techniques.
### Project Breakdown
### Data Understanding and Setup
#### Data Loading:

I began by loading Rockbuster’s dataset, which included information on the film inventory, customers, payments, and more.
#### SQL Queries:

Wrote SQL queries to explore relationships between tables, calculate revenue contributions, analyze customer locations, and more.
#### Data Analysis:

Performed a range of SQL-based analyses, including basic CRUD operations, filtering, summarizing, joining tables, and using subqueries and common table expressions (CTEs).
#### Data Presentation:

Compiled insights into a clear, visual format that could be presented to Rockbuster Stealth’s management board. The presentation included graphs, charts, and key findings to support business strategy decisions.
### Learning Outcomes
This project offered a comprehensive experience in SQL query writing, relational database management, and data-driven decision-making. Through this work, I strengthened my ability to:

- Write complex SQL queries to answer real-world business questions.
- Create compelling data visualizations for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Present analytical results professionally, contributing to strategic business outcomes.
### Final Deliverables
The final deliverables include:

- A set of SQL queries answering business-critical questions.
- Data visualizations illustrating key findings.
- A presentation summarizing the insights and recommendations for Rockbuster’s management.
